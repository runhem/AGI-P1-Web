         <h2>Leif Thysell Sundqvist</h2>
         <h3>Artist</h3>
<p>Mainly responsible for 2D and 3D design and assets as well as illustrations and animations. The 3D models were modelled in Blender and directly exported to the project in Unity. The 2D assets were designed in Adobe Photoshop, and  the animated videos in Blender as well as Adobe After Effects.

I also assisted with game mechanics and functionality whenever there was need of an extra hand.</p>

         <h2>Gustav Johansson</h2>
         <h3>Game Developer</h3>
        <p>Gustav’s focus in this project have mainly been on game mechanics; animating collectibles, developing functionality for power ups, integrating modalities such as vibration on collision and moving the zeppelin when blowing on the screen, signal processing, creating the leaderboard - both programmatically but also the UI design. He has also been rewriting parts of the code to make it more object oriented and scalable for future use.</p>
