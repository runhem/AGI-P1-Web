    <h2>Goals and motivation</h2>
    <p>
The goal of ZeppelinARe has been to make as much use of the augmented reality medium as appropriate, without confusing the users. Implementing  a game with familiar mechanics and instructions, we put much of our focus on an unconventional interaction method. Our motivation has been to create a game that could be played in any surrounding, making use of the space and at the same time encourage replay-ability!</p>

  <h2>Graphics</h2>
  <p>Our choice of graphics are aerially themed, with the zeppelin, the airdrops with little parachutes and boundaries/fences that are carried by tiny balloons. </p>

  <h2>Interaction</h2>
  <p>The interaction method, making use of the augmented reality medium and avoiding UI elements to control the events, follows the theme as well. The interaction technology makes use of the microphone, and technically the player could make different sounds, but asking them to blow on the screen the player simulates the wind in the propeller of the zeppelin, adding to the aerial context and enabling a fun and unconventional interaction for controlling events. Using the mix between virtuality and reality of AR the game mixes realism, like the zeppelin moving with physics like expected, with some aspects that are somewhat surreal, like the tiny balloons carrying the entire fence. </p>

  <h2>Challenges and lessons learned</h2>
  <p>Challenges / Obstacles
  Interaction method, only listening to the right audio sources
  Lack of hardware
  Collaboration tool of Unity
  Understand depth perception in AR environments - solved by adding shadows and having small size objects</p>
